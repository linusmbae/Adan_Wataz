            <h2>who we are.</h2>
            <p>Adan_Wataz is a water Services Provider company(WASPC) that is newly registered in 2019 under the Societies Act (CAP 108), Laws of Kenya as an association of Water Services Providers (WSPA's) in the country.</p>
            <p> The enactment of the Water Act 2002 created new institutions (water companies) to manage water resources in Kenya.The Companies took over the provision of water and sewerage services from their respective municipal councils. This therefore placed the water companies at the leading edge to consolidate the knowledge and share experiences, the water services providers formed WASPA to provide a forum for the various companies to learn from each other.</p> 
            <p>Adan_Wataz has gained relevance in the water sector due to its elaborate network and coordinating role of WSP's, advocacy with the Ministry and other actors in the water sector.</p>
